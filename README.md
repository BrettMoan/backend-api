# backend-api

This repository defines and deploys a serverless backend API using Terraform and AWS. It demonstrates event-driven architecture, automated API deployment, and secure CI/CD with OIDC-enabled GitHub Actions.

## Features
- Serverless API (Lambda, API Gateway)
- Event-driven processing (DynamoDB, SNS, Streams)
- Modular, infrastructure-as-code design
- OIDC-enabled GitHub Actions workflow

## Part of a Multi-Repo Demo
This repo is part of a larger, opinionated infrastructure demonstration. See the [brettmoan main overview](https://github.com/brettmoan/README.md) for the full architecture and design rationale.
